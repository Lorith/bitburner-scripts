# bitburner-scripts
 Just scripts for the game Bitburner.

Main ones I use:
  unihack, basic-batcher(very slightly buggy), contracts(WIP), quickrun is testing file, stocks.
  utils/single: doorcrasher, scan-vars, startup
  utills/const: buy_servs, hud_edits

Basically all the others are remnants of earlier work or WIP.
